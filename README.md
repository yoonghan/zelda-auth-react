# Microfrontend v2, with REACT

This is an authentication project that is based on react, which act as the controller for user signup and user profiler.

## Usage

1. Execute the project for use with zelda-root

```
npm start -- --port 8500
```

2. Execute the project for local development 

```
npm run start:standalone
```

## Deployment

1. Project deployment works differently as there is *NO* hosting page. Means navigating to the page e.g. https://zelda-auth-react-walcoorperation.vercel.app/ will deal with NO Page found.
2. All hosted microservice must be access via the js script, as in https://<host>/walcron-zelda-auth-react.js
